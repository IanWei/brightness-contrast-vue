## Preface
```
This is my first time to contact Vue.js. I took some time to learn it, 
and found that it is an easy-to-learn framework of JavaScript. 
Although some features I haven't touched, I'll keep exploring and learn Vue.js.

The project I haven't integrated SASS feature with it. 
I'll integrate this feature in future to keep the code more concise.
I'm so glad that I have this chance to learn a new framework by the Code Challenge.
